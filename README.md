The primary goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information on sepsis illness to identify key attributes that contribute to the development and progression of the disease. Additionally, the project aims to uncover trends and survival patterns over time using advanced statistical methods.
I used Logistic Regression to identify the most significant attributes that contribute to the occurrence of sepsis. Then, I used To analyze the survival patterns and trends of patients with sepsis over time. Here I used two models: Kaplan-Meyer and Cox Model. Kaplan-Meier Estimator: This non-parametric statistic was used to estimate the survival function from the lifetime data. It helps in understanding the proportion of patients surviving for a certain amount of time after diagnosis.
Cox Proportional-Hazards Model: This semi-parametric model was utilized to explore the relationship between the survival time of patients and one or more predictor variables. It allows for the assessment of how different factors impact survival rates.
